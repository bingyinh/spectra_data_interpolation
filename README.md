# spectra_data_interpolation
The tool is designed for taking multiple spectra data coordinates, merging their X axes, and interpolating the missing values. This tool is useful when you need to divide or multiply one spectra over another in a point-by-point pattern, which requires two spectra to share the same X axes.
